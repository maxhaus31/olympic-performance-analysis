# Olympic Performance Analysis – Data Visualization & Analytics

## Overview
This project analyzes factors contributing to Olympic success by examining more than 120 years of historical Olympic data enriched with external socioeconomic and geographic datasets. The goal was to identify the structural patterns behind medal success and demonstrate how data visualization can communicate complex analytical insights.
My particular focus was on exploring the correlation between performance and whether the Olympic Games took place in the home country or on the home continent, as well as the correlation between performance and distance traveled.

## Project Objectives
- Analyze long-term Olympic performance trends using historical data (1896–2016)
- Measure geographic effects such as home advantage and travel distance
- Communicate insights through interactive, business-oriented visualizations

## My Contribution
This was a group project completed as part of a Data Visualization for Business Analytics course.  
My primary responsibilities included:

- **Data curation and preparation**
  - Cleaning and structuring over 200,000 records from the Summer Olympic Games
  - Handling missing values and creating analytical features (e.g., medal indicators)
  - Filtering and standardizing the dataset to ensure consistency and reliability
  - Merging external datasets using country (NOC) identifiers

- **Analysis and visualization for Question 3 (Geographic Effects)**
  - Analyzing home advantage and travel-distance effects on medal performance
  - Designing Tableau visualizations to highlight geographic patterns and efficiency
  - Interpreting results and translating findings into clear analytical insights

- Contribution to the final written report and interpretation of results

## Data Curation & Preparation
The primary dataset used was *“120 Years of Olympic History – Athletes and Results”* (Kaggle), containing athlete-level records from 1896 to 2016.

Key data preparation steps included:
- Restricting the analysis to **Summer Olympic Games** to ensure data consistency and historical depth
- Handling missing medal values by explicitly labeling non-medal outcomes
- Creating derived features such as:
  - Binary medal indicators
  - Total medals per athlete
- Filtering out irregular or discontinued sports to reduce noise and ensure meaningful comparisons
- Integrating external datasets (e.g., Human Development Index) for socioeconomic analysis

The curated dataset formed the foundation for all subsequent analysis and visualizations.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Tableau Public** – interactive dashboards and visual storytelling
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** – data exploration, cleaning, and feature engineering
- **Statistical analysis** – descriptive statistics and comparative analysis

---

## Key Insights
- Olympic success is strongly correlated with national development indicators such as HDI
- Medal-winning athletes differ physiologically from the general population in sport-specific ways, not through a universal “Olympic phenotype”
- Host nations experience a significant performance boost (~40%)
- Medal efficiency decreases as travel distance to the host city increases

These findings suggest that Olympic success is influenced by infrastructure, strategic investment, and geographic context, not only individual talent.

## Project Context
- **Course:** Data Visualization for Business Analytics
- **Institution:** Nova SBE
- **Type:** Academic group project
- **Focus:** Data-driven decision support through visualization

## Notes
The analysis and visualizations were created for educational purposes using publicly available data.
